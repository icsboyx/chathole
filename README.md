# Rust Server Engine

This is a Rust project that uses multi-threading to handle server operations. It uses the `colored` and `terminal_ansi` crates for terminal output, and the `anyhow` crate for error handling.

## Installation

To install and run this project, you need to have Rust installed on your machine. If you don't have Rust installed, you can install it from the [official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/icsboyx/chathole.git
cd chathole
```

## Usage

To run the project:

```bash
cargo run
```
### Server Commands

The server supports the following commands:

- `/nick <nick>`: This command is used to change your nickname on the server. Replace `<nick>` with the nickname you want to use.

- `/join <channel>`: This command is used to join a specific channel on the server. Replace `<channel>` with the name of the channel you want to join.

- `/help`: This command is used to display the help information, which includes a list of all available commands and their descriptions.

These commands are highlighted in yellow in the terminal for better visibility.
